      <p>Myanmar has been in a state of constant civil war ever since its independence in 1948. The disputes inside Myanmar have resulted in the chaos of the region and the instability of the international society. During the period, thousands of refugees had fled to neighbouring countries. Since 1962, in which a military coup took place due to the continuing civil war and the perceived threats of secession by ethnic states, the Myanmar Armed Forces, officially known as Tatmadaw, has seen itself as the dominant force that avert the country from splitting.</p>
      <p>As a historical milestone of Myanmar, the “Nationwide Ceasefire Accord” was passed among the government and eight ethnically centered rebel groups on 15th October 2015. It could have been a positive step to resolve the longest-running civil war in the world, yet more than seven rebel groups refused to sign, and the peace of the country was still left unknown. Continuous military actions from the opposite factions have still been a severe threat to Burmese’s lives, and more and more refugees are forced to leave their homes. Interference on this accord from other countries around the world has also prompted the instability in Myanmar, and the conflicts on boarder even result in the death of neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p>Without any further effective solutions, even the temporary peace in certain regions might be undermined and Burmese people could struggle in the civil war once again. How will the destiny of the Burmese be? Will the “Nationwide Ceasefire Accord” be a flush of hope, or will it be the darkness before dawn? Now, delegates, this is your opportunity to make things better and bring hope to citizens in Myanmar! The future of Myanmar is in your hands, and we are here waiting for you to make a difference.</p>
      <p>Welcome, Delegates of United Nation Security Council!</p>

      <p>Cooperation programs initiated by China. The theory of AIIB was originally formed in 2013, while on January the 16th‬, the AIIB was formally opened for business.</p>
      <p>During the conference, delegates would be classified into Directors, Governors and Observing countries that play various roles in AIIB. The diversity of seats, the responsibilities and works would be divided into several parts through the seats. Governors and observing countries would enjoy the power to hand in cooperation programs while Directors would hold the highest decision-making power to select only one cooperation program to put into further use. </p>
      <p>The whole conference would be divided into two parts, the first round presentation and the second round discussion. Inquiry and specific discussions could be processed after every presentation. Every delegate has equal rights to discuss about programs and every single individual in the conference would be able to speak out and comment. As the AIIB mainly targets on six aspects: energy and power, transportation and telecommunications, rural infrastructure and agriculture development, water supply and sanitation, environmental protection, urban development and logistics; six programs would be proposed according to the focus. The first round vote would be processed right after the presentation and discussion of one program. Every delegate could participant in this round vote, and a program may need to reach a 2/3 majority to pass this round vote. During the second round discussion, delegates are supposed to compare all the programs that pass the first round vote. However, only Directors could engage in the second round vote, and only one program could pass this round vote. The voting number of this round vote is calculated based on the special voting shares of AIIB. </p>
      <p>Considering the special position of AIIB, conflicts would take place during the conference, but we are confidentthat all the delegates would eventually reach cooperation.Dear delegates, the future of Asia is now under your control, and we are here, waiting for you to take part in the conference.</p>

      <p>This committee does not require any finance or economics background. It is a mock financial platform for you to learn the basic knowledge and skill in the real business world, and offer you a hands-on experience of what financial analyst, investment banking investors, venture capital companies, and private equity firms are doing, and how to do business professional research. The key point is not about what number you got. Instead, the key point of this committee is help you to learn how to evaluate and what are the logic and the reasoning.</p>
      <p>A leveraged buyout (LBO) is the acquisition of another company using a significant amount of borrowed money to meetthe cost of acquisition. It is the process that LBO investors choose the declining public traded companies and purchase its ownership to restructure it. Then, investor can re-organize the management team and improve its performance and capability in 3-5 years, and re-sell it to win the return. The process is similar to buying a house on the housing loan. People buy a house with the bank loans. They will use the rent generated by the house to pay back the interest and principal of the loan. In 3-5 years, theywill try to raise the price of the house and sell it to retire all of the debt and earn a lot of return.</p>
      <p>Renren Inc. operates a social networking internet platform in the People’s Republic of China. The company provides online advertising services; Internet value-added services (IVAS), including online talent show, VIP memberships, live stream, other IVAS, etc.; and online gaming services. The company was formerly known as Oak Pacific Interactive and changed its name to Renren Inc. in December 2010. Renren Inc. was founded in 2002 and is headquartered in Beijing, the People’s Republic of China.</p>
      <p>The company used to be one of the major social network service providers in China. However, due to management issues and inappropriate diversification, Renren’s market share and financial performance declined a lot in recent few years. The company has a relatively mature team that it does not require massive cash investment or capitalization to improve its performance. Therefore, it is a feasible target for LBO investors. </p>
      <p>The committee consists of three parties. The first party consists of the current shareholder and management board of the company. These delegates need to consider investors and investment banks’ offers, and bargain with such investors about the condition of the acquisition. The second part consists of investment bankers. Investment Banks are the main source of funding of LBO investor to complete the acquisition. Therefore, they have to assess the conditions in order to secure bank loans. The third party consists of leverage buyout investors such as private equity firms. Delegates of different investor need to propose their evaluation of the firm and negotiate with the shareholder about the prices.</p>

      <p class="chinesetext">西元1918年冬，當停戰的協議在貢比涅森林簽署時，和平的曙光似乎將再一次照耀飽受戰亂摧殘的歐羅巴。戰勝及中立國約定於次年在法國巴黎凡爾賽宮會商，以期開啓未來數十年的和平時代。後世稱其為巴黎和會。</p>
      <p class="chinesetext">和會為歐洲帶來了和平的希冀，為中國則帶來了一些其他的希望：民族獨立、收回領土，以及雪洗近八十年的屈辱和不公。懷揣這樣的希望，分裂和對峙的中國走向一體。那些最優秀的外交官們代表著各自的政治派別，懷揣著相同的夢想，組成了巴黎和會中國代表團，來到戰火之後的歐洲，嘗試打破那束縛在中華民族身上八十年的枷鎖。在他們的身後，有政治家的盤算、報人的預測、知識分子的呼號，更有億萬普通中國人重新站起來的期望。</p>
      <p class="chinesetext">然而夢想卻必須面對現實的挑戰，外部的強權和危機遠超乎外交官們的預測；代表團內部的政治分歧，階級差異，利益矛盾甚至私人恩怨，亦無時無刻不在侵蝕著中國外交官們的團結與熱情：民族夢想、團體利益、個人主義，何者為先？面對國際的不公、國內的紛亂，該何去何從？</p>
      <p class="chinesetext">來吧，帶著忐忑和些許的希望，讓我們回到1919年，回到巴黎的呂特蒂旅館，回到巴黎和會中國代表團的常務會議上，用你的雙手在這個沒有硝煙的戰場上，為中國爭取一個明天！</p>

      <p class="chinesetext">中国系统作为聚焦中国热点改革议题的联动会议体系，在单个会场内部以及会场间联动中结合中国政治体制特点，力图构建既符合中国特色又同时允许代表充分实践个人理念的独特平台。</p>
      <p class="chinesetext">中国系统主要关注宏观政策体制改革，模拟公共政策的制定流程。在此流程中，我们希望通过模拟不同的维度、不同的立场，来达到汇集声音，凝聚共识的目的。在增加对公民参与政策制定途径的了解的同时，我们也希望能让代表认清中国的现状，学会理性客观地看待、思考和讨论社会热点问题，从而唤醒真正的公民意识。</p>
      <p class="chinesetext">今年暑假中国系统将会探讨“中国户籍制度改革”这一议题。我们不仅仅会关注户籍本身职能的改革，也会重点地去讨论附加于户籍之上的公共资源分配、社会权益和公民权利义务等的调整。同时在国务院《关于进一步推进户籍制度改革的意见》的指导下，完成地方政策法规的制定，以达到“四个全面”战略布局和文件中对户籍制度改革的要求，也希望能在达成理论之中户籍改革目标——“让户籍制度回归本身的统计、管理人口信息的功能”的路上又进一步。</p>
      <p class="chinesetext">这次中国系统会分为三个会场，分别从政府机关、省级大人、各阶层公众的角度来完成对议题的全面系统地剖析。会中，我们也会采用一定的分会期制度来更真实地模拟政策制定中不同主体间的互动关系。</p>
      <p class="chinesetext">审视身边习以为常的社会惯性，实践自己对公共政策的理念追求，中国系统与你相约今年暑假！</p>
